***Real-time Air Pollution Monitoring in Delhi Using Online Anomaly Detection Algorithms for Streaming Data***

In this research, nine unsupervised online anomaly detection models for streaming data are used to monitor AQI in Delhi. Gaseous pollutants are monitored in real time, for the presence of anomalies, at 20 base stations located in the most polluted sites in Delhi, from May 1, 2022, to April 30, 2023.
